# NE155-Final-Project

This code is designed to solve diffusion equations in two dimensions.

It requires two inputs. The first should be a file name where the code reads the data from. The other should be a file name where the code should write the solution to.

The input file should contain the following in the exact order:

- n, size of matrix  
- delta, cell width  
- epsilon, cell height  
- varepsilon, iterative tolerance  
- D, nxn matrix of diffusion coefficients  
- \sigma, nxn matrix of cross sections  
- S, nxn matrix of source values
